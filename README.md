# esd virgo-tools

We (ESD, www.ches.pro) are basing our product on Virgo. To support our development team as good as possible, we have forked Eclipse's Virgo Tools (http://git.eclipse.org/c/virgo/org.eclipse.virgo.ide.git) and extended them with our custom needs - that is what you can find here in this repository.
